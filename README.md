# dungeonPython
2D Randomly generated dungeon game.

Created by Lincoln Fuller
Created with Python 3.2

  Experimenting with randomly generated levels.
The challenge was ensuring the player could
always get from the entrance to the exit without a
wall obstructing their path. Most all art in the game
is original, but inspiration was taken from Indiana Jones.
